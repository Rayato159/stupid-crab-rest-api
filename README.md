<h1>Stupid ðŸ¦€ CRUD using Axum</h1>

<p>I just practice a Rust for the reason of Golang boring. I need more challenging in my backend developer career path.</p>

<p>Therefore, I've made this project. Just a stupid project but have made me proud.</p>

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("THIS IS MY 1st FOR ðŸ¦€")
}
```
